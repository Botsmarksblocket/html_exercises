    <h1>What is WWW (World Wide Web)?</h1>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web (WWW), often simply called the Web, is a system of
      interlinked hypertext documents and resources that can be accessed via the
      internet. Created in 1989 by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee, the Web
      allows users to view and navigate various types of information, including
      text, images, video, and more, through web browsers.
